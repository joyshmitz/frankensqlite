# Plan to Port SQLite to Rust

## 1. Scope

### What We Are Building

FrankenSQLite is a **clean-room Rust reimplementation** of SQLite version 3.52.0.
The reference C codebase is approximately 218,000 lines of C (core library, not
counting test code or generated amalgamation). FrankenSQLite targets full SQL
compatibility, file format round-trip interoperability with C SQLite, and a
strictly safe Rust implementation (`unsafe_code = "forbid"` at workspace level).

The project is organized as a Cargo workspace of **23 crates** under the
`crates/` directory, following the same layout conventions used in the
`frankentui` project.

### The Key Innovation: MVCC Concurrent Writers

SQLite's single biggest architectural limitation is its write concurrency model.
In WAL mode, a single exclusive lock byte (`WAL_WRITE_LOCK` at `wal.c:3698`)
serializes all writers. Any connection attempting to write while another holds
this lock receives `SQLITE_BUSY` and must retry.

FrankenSQLite replaces this with **MVCC page-level versioning**:

- **Multiple concurrent writers.** Two transactions modifying different B-tree
  pages proceed in full parallel with zero contention.
- **Snapshot isolation.** Each transaction captures a consistent point-in-time
  view at BEGIN. Long-running readers never block writers.
- **Page-level conflict detection.** When two transactions modify the same page,
  the conflict is detected eagerly at write time (not deferred to commit).
  First-committer-wins semantics with immediate `SQLITE_BUSY` for the second
  writer -- no deadlocks are possible.
- **Unlimited concurrent readers.** No `aReadMark[5]` limit. Any number of
  readers can hold independent snapshots simultaneously.
- **WAL append serialization.** The expensive part (B-tree modifications) runs
  in parallel. Only the cheap part (sequential WAL frame appends) is serialized
  via a mutex, preserving correctness with minimal contention.

This design is similar in spirit to PostgreSQL's MVCC, but operates at page
granularity rather than tuple granularity, matching the B-tree page-oriented
storage architecture.

### Why Page-Level Granularity

Page-level MVCC was chosen as the sweet spot between complexity and concurrency:

- **Row-level MVCC** (as in PostgreSQL) would require fundamental changes to the
  record format, a visibility map, and per-row transaction metadata. This would
  break file-format compatibility and add significant space overhead.
- **Table-level MVCC** would be too coarse. Two writers inserting into different
  parts of the same table would conflict unnecessarily. Since SQLite is often
  used with just a few tables, table-level locking would provide little benefit
  over the existing single-writer model.
- **Page-level MVCC** maps naturally to SQLite's B-tree structure. Each page is
  the unit of I/O and caching, so versioning at this level adds no new
  abstraction. Writers to different parts of the same B-tree (different leaf
  pages) can proceed in parallel.

### Target Behavior

- Read and write standard SQLite database files (format compatible with C SQLite)
- Support the full SQL dialect recognized by SQLite 3.52.0
- Implement all major extensions (FTS3/4/5, R-tree, JSON1, Session, ICU, misc)
- Provide a drop-in interactive CLI shell replacement
- Achieve 95%+ conformance against a golden-file test suite derived from C SQLite

---

## 2. Exclusions

The following components of the C SQLite codebase are explicitly **not ported**:

### Amalgamation Build System

SQLite's distribution model relies on a generated amalgamation (`sqlite3.c` +
`sqlite3.h`) produced by a custom TCL build script. FrankenSQLite uses a
standard Cargo workspace with 23 crates and has no need for source
concatenation.

### TCL Test Harness

The C SQLite test suite is written in TCL (~90,000+ lines of test scripts).
FrankenSQLite replaces this with:
- Native Rust `#[test]` functions in each crate
- Property-based tests via `proptest`
- Snapshot tests via `insta`
- Fuzz tests via `cargo-fuzz`
- A dedicated conformance harness (`fsqlite-harness`) that compares output
  against C SQLite golden files

### LEMON Parser Generator

SQLite uses a custom LALR parser generator called LEMON to produce a push-down
automaton from the `parse.y` grammar (1,963 lines). FrankenSQLite instead uses
a **hand-written recursive descent parser** with Pratt precedence for
expressions. This provides better error messages, simpler maintenance, and
avoids the need for a code generation step.

### Loadable Extension API (.so/.dll Loading)

SQLite supports runtime-loaded shared library extensions via
`sqlite3_load_extension()`. FrankenSQLite compiles all extensions directly into
their respective crates and links them at build time. There is no dynamic
loading mechanism. Extensions are enabled or disabled via Cargo feature flags.

### Legacy File Format Quirks

The SQLite file format has accumulated backward-compatibility quirks from the
pre-3.0 era (2004). FrankenSQLite targets schema format number 4 (the current
format) and does not implement support for:
- Schema format numbers 1, 2, or 3
- Legacy typeAffinity mappings from SQLite 2.x
- DESC index encoding variations from early format versions

### Obsolete VFS Implementations

The C SQLite source includes VFS implementations for operating systems that
are no longer relevant:
- **OS/2** (`os_os2.c`) -- IBM OS/2, discontinued
- **VxWorks** -- real-time OS specific paths in `os_unix.c`
- **Windows CE** (`os_win.c` conditional sections) -- discontinued platform

FrankenSQLite implements:
- `UnixVfs` -- POSIX file I/O via `asupersync::BlockingPool`
- `MemoryVfs` -- in-memory storage for testing and ephemeral databases

Windows VFS support may be added in the future as a separate crate but is not
in scope for initial delivery.

### Shared-Cache Mode

SQLite's shared-cache mode (`SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE`) allows multiple
connections within the same process to share a single page cache and B-tree
instance, using table-level locking for concurrency. This mode is deprecated
in modern SQLite and is architecturally superseded by FrankenSQLite's MVCC
design, which provides superior concurrency without the complexity and
limitations of shared-cache table locks.

---

## 3. Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap and Spec Extraction

**Goal:** Create the workspace scaffold, write specification documents, and
establish the project infrastructure.

**Work items:**
- Create workspace `Cargo.toml` with `resolver = "2"`, `edition = "2024"`,
  `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, and `clippy::pedantic = "deny"` +
  `clippy::nursery = "deny"`
- Create `rust-toolchain.toml` (nightly channel)
- Scaffold all 23 crate directories with stub `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs`
- Write `EXISTING_SQLITE_STRUCTURE.md` (complete behavior extraction from C
  source: all data structures from `sqliteInt.h`, SQL grammar from `parse.y`,
  all 190+ VDBE opcodes from `vdbe.c`, B-tree page format, WAL frame format,
  database file header, all PRAGMA behaviors, all built-in functions, extension
  APIs)
- Write `PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Rust design: MVCC detail, trait hierarchy,
  crate dependency graph, async integration patterns, query pipeline, file
  format compatibility, testing strategy)
- Write `PLAN_TO_PORT_SQLITE_TO_RUST.md` (this document)
- Update `AGENTS.md` for the FrankenSQLite project

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `cargo check --workspace` completes with zero errors
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` produces zero warnings
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passes
- All three specification documents are complete and reviewed

---

### Phase 2: Core Types and Storage Foundation

**Goal:** Implement the foundational type system and the lowest layers of the
storage stack (VFS, pager, page cache).

**Work items:**
- `fsqlite-types`: `PageNumber(u32)`, `PageSize`, `PageData`, `SqliteValue`
  enum (Null, Integer(i64), Float(f64), Text(String), Blob(Vec<u8>)), all 190+
  VDBE opcodes as an enum, `SQLITE_MAX_*` limit constants, serial type
  encoding, bitflag types (OpenFlags, SyncFlags, LockLevel)
- `fsqlite-error`: `FrankenError` enum using `thiserror`, error codes matching
  SQLite result codes, `StructuredError` with source location
- `fsqlite-vfs`: `Vfs` and `VfsFile` traits, `MemoryVfs` implementation,
  `UnixVfs` implementation with `asupersync` blocking I/O
- `fsqlite-pager`: Pager state machine, page cache with LRU eviction,
  dirty page tracking

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `cargo check --workspace` clean
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean
- Memory VFS stores and retrieves pages correctly
- 200+ unit tests passing

---

### Phase 3: B-Tree and SQL Parser

**Goal:** Implement the B-tree storage engine and the SQL parsing pipeline.

**B-Tree work (`fsqlite-btree`):**
Port from `btree.c` (11,568 lines) and `btreeInt.h`:
- `cursor.rs` -- BtCursor with page stack traversal (max depth 20)
- `cell.rs` -- Cell format parsing (INTKEY tables, BLOBKEY indexes)
- `balance.rs` -- Page splitting (balance_nonroot, balance_deeper)
- `overflow.rs` -- Overflow page chains
- `free_list.rs` -- Free page management (trunk + leaf pages)
- `payload.rs` -- BtreePayload read/write with overflow handling

**SQL Parser work (`fsqlite-parser` + `fsqlite-ast`):**
Hand-written recursive descent replacing LEMON-generated parser:
- `lexer.rs` -- Tokenizer (from `tokenize.c`, 899 lines) with
  `memchr`-accelerated scanning, zero-copy token spans
- `parser.rs` -- Main parser with Pratt precedence for expressions
- `keyword.rs` -- Perfect hash keyword lookup (150+ SQL keywords)
- AST types for all SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE,
  DROP, ALTER, PRAGMA, ATTACH/DETACH, BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK, EXPLAIN, etc.)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- B-tree integrity check passes after 10,000 random inserts
- Parser handles 95%+ of the SQLite SQL grammar
- 500+ tests passing

---

### Phase 4: VDBE and Query Pipeline

**Goal:** Implement the bytecode virtual machine, query planner, code generator,
and public API to enable end-to-end SQL execution.

**VDBE work (`fsqlite-vdbe`):**
Port from `vdbe.c` (9,316 lines):
- Core fetch-execute loop with match-based opcode dispatch
- 50+ critical opcodes first: Transaction, OpenRead, OpenWrite, Seek*, Column,
  Insert, Delete, Goto, If, ResultRow, MakeRecord, Halt, Function
- `mem.rs` -- Mem/sqlite3_value with type affinity conversions
- `sort.rs` -- External merge sort for ORDER BY

**Query Planner (`fsqlite-planner`):**
Port from `resolve.c`, `where.c`, `wherecode.c`, `whereexpr.c`:
- Name resolution (table and column binding)
- Index selection and cost estimation
- Basic join ordering (greedy heuristic)

**Core Assembly (`fsqlite-core`):**
- `connection.rs` -- sqlite3 struct equivalent
- `prepare.rs` -- SQL text -> parsed AST -> VDBE bytecode
- `schema.rs` -- Schema cache management
- SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE code generation

**Public API (`fsqlite`):**
- `Connection::open`, `Connection::open_in_memory`
- `Connection::execute`, `Connection::prepare`
- `Statement::query_map`, `Statement::query_row`
- `Row::get::<T>(index)` with `FromSql` trait
- `Transaction` with commit/rollback

**Acceptance criteria:**
- End-to-end execution: CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT with WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT
- 1,000+ tests passing

---

### Phase 5: Persistence, WAL, and Transactions

**Goal:** Implement durable storage with file-backed persistence, WAL mode, and
full transaction semantics.

**Persistence:**
- Unix VFS with POSIX file locking (fcntl advisory locks)
- Rollback journal mode (DELETE, TRUNCATE, PERSIST, MEMORY, OFF)
- Database file format compatibility (read C SQLite files, write files C SQLite
  can read)

**WAL (`fsqlite-wal`):**
- WAL frame writing and reading (32-byte WAL header, 24-byte frame headers)
- WAL index (page-to-frame-offset hash mapping via shared memory / `-shm` file)
- Checkpoint modes: PASSIVE, FULL, RESTART, TRUNCATE
- Crash recovery (scan WAL, replay committed frames, discard uncommitted)
- Snapshot isolation for readers

**Transactions:**
- BEGIN DEFERRED / IMMEDIATE / EXCLUSIVE
- COMMIT and ROLLBACK
- Savepoints: SAVEPOINT name / RELEASE name / ROLLBACK TO name
- Auto-commit mode
- Statement journaling for statement-level rollback
- PRAGMA journal_mode, synchronous, cache_size

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Create database, close, reopen, read back data correctly
- WAL mode: concurrent readers + single writer
- Crash recovery: kill mid-transaction, verify database consistency on reopen
- File format round-trip with C SQLite (create with one, read with the other)
- 1,500+ tests passing

---

### Phase 6: MVCC Concurrent Writers

**This is the architectural centerpiece that makes FrankenSQLite different
from SQLite.**

**Goal:** Replace the single-writer WAL model with MVCC page-level versioning
to enable truly concurrent writers.

**Core MVCC types (`fsqlite-mvcc`):**
- `version_store.rs` -- Page version chains (copy-on-write per page)
- `transaction.rs` -- TxnId (atomic u64 counter), transaction lifecycle
- `visibility.rs` -- Snapshot isolation visibility rules:
  - A page version V is visible to snapshot S if and only if:
    1. `V.created_by <= S.high_water_mark`
    2. `V.created_by NOT IN S.in_flight`
    3. V is the most recent version satisfying conditions (1) and (2)
- `conflict.rs` -- Page-level lock table (`BTreeMap<PageNumber, TxnId>`) +
  first-committer-wins validation
- `gc.rs` -- GC horizon = `min(active_txn_ids)`, truncate old versions that
  have been superseded by committed versions below the horizon
- `mvcc_wal.rs` -- MVCC-aware WAL with per-transaction frame groups
- `page_version.rs` -- `PageVersion { pgno, created_by: TxnId, data, prev }`

**MVCC-aware page access:**
- `MvccPager::get_page(pgno, snapshot)` replaces `sqlite3PagerGet()` with a
  three-tier lookup: buffer pool -> WAL index -> database file
- `MvccPager::write_page(pgno, txn)` replaces `sqlite3PagerWrite()` with page
  lock acquisition, copy-on-write versioning, and write set recording

**Buffer pool:**
- `BTreeMap<(PageNumber, TxnId), CachedPage>` -- multiple versions of same page
  coexist in the cache
- LRU eviction of unreferenced, clean, superseded versions
- Default capacity: 2,000 pages (~8MB at 4KB page size)
- Dirty pages never evicted until flushed to WAL

**Asupersync integration:**
- All file I/O via `BlockingPool` (1 min, 4 max threads)
- `Cx` capability context for cooperative cancellation at VDBE instruction
  boundaries
- `asupersync::sync::RwLock` for `active_transactions` map
- `asupersync::channel::mpsc` (two-phase reserve/commit) for write coordinator
  commit pipeline
- `asupersync::channel::oneshot` for commit response

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Two connections insert into different tables simultaneously -- no blocking
- Two connections insert into same table, different pages -- both succeed
- Same-page conflict: second committer gets proper error
- 100 concurrent writers x 100 rows each -- all 10,000 rows present after
  completion
- Snapshot isolation: long-running reader sees consistent state despite
  concurrent commits
- GC reclaims memory after long-running readers close
- Under 2x overhead vs single-writer for non-contended workloads
- 2,000+ tests passing

---

### Phase 7: Advanced Query Planner and Full VDBE

**Goal:** Complete the query optimizer and implement all remaining VDBE opcodes
and SQL features.

**Work items:**
- Complete WHERE clause optimization (index selection, range scans, OR
  optimization, skip-scan, LIKE/GLOB prefix optimization)
- Join ordering (nested loop join, hash join for large tables)
- Subquery flattening and correlated subqueries
- All 190+ VDBE opcodes (including Bloom filter, virtual table, authorization)
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, NTILE,
  FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE; frame types ROWS/RANGE/GROUPS)
- Common table expressions (WITH, WITH RECURSIVE)
- ANALYZE statistics (sqlite_stat1, sqlite_stat4)
- Foreign key enforcement
- Triggers (BEFORE, AFTER, INSTEAD OF; INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE; recursive)
- Views (definition, expansion, updatable via INSTEAD OF triggers)
- ALTER TABLE (RENAME TABLE, RENAME COLUMN, ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN)
- VACUUM and REINDEX

**Acceptance criteria:**
- TPC-B benchmark within 3x of C SQLite performance
- EXPLAIN output matches C SQLite for common query patterns
- 3,000+ tests passing

---

### Phase 8: Extensions

**Goal:** Implement all major SQLite extensions, each in its own feature-gated
crate.

| Extension | Crate | C Source Reference | Key Components |
|-----------|-------|--------------------|----------------|
| JSON1 | `fsqlite-ext-json` | `ext/misc/json.c` (171KB) | `json()`, `json_extract()`, `json_set()`, `json_remove()`, `json_each` vtable, `json_tree` vtable, `json_group_array()`, `json_group_object()`, `json_patch()`, JSONB binary format |

| Session | `fsqlite-ext-session` | `ext/session/` (13K LOC) | Change tracking, changeset/patchset generation and application, conflict resolution, inversion, concatenation, rebasing |
| ICU | `fsqlite-ext-icu` | `ext/icu/` | Unicode-aware collation, case folding, FTS tokenizer |
| Misc | `fsqlite-ext-misc` | `ext/misc/` | `generate_series`, `carray`, `dbstat`, `dbpage`, `completion`, `csv`, decimal, ieee754, uuid |

**Acceptance criteria:**
- FTS5 queries return correct ranked results
- JSON functions match C SQLite output for all documented behaviors
- Each extension independently enableable via Cargo feature flags
- 3,500+ tests passing

---

### Phase 9: CLI Shell and Conformance

**Goal:** Deliver a production-quality interactive CLI and achieve verified
conformance against C SQLite.

**CLI (`fsqlite-cli`):**
Interactive shell built with `frankentui`:
- Dot-commands: `.tables`, `.schema`, `.mode`, `.import`, `.dump`, `.headers`,
  `.explain`, `.backup`, `.databases`, `.dbinfo`, `.indexes`, `.fullschema`,
  `.stats`, `.timer`, `.width`, `.separator`, `.nullvalue`, `.output`, `.once`,
  `.read`, `.open`, `.save`, `.restore`, `.quit`
- Output modes: ascii, box, column, csv, html, insert, json, line, list,
  markdown, quote, table, tabs
- Tab completion for table names, column names, SQL keywords, and dot-commands
- SQL syntax highlighting
- Command history with persistence (`~/.frankensqlite_history`)
- Init file support (`~/.frankensqliterc`)
- Batch mode (read SQL from stdin or file)
- Signal handling (Ctrl-C to cancel query, Ctrl-D to exit)

**Conformance suite (`fsqlite-harness`):**
- Execute identical SQL against both FrankenSQLite and C sqlite3
- Compare output row-by-row (order-sensitive for ORDER BY, order-insensitive
  otherwise)
- Error code matching (same error for same malformed input)
- Type affinity and NULL handling verification
- Golden file storage in `conformance/golden/`
- Target: 95%+ conformance across 1,000+ test SQL files
- Known incompatibilities documented with rationale

**Benchmarks:**
- `benches/btree_insert.rs` -- insertion throughput
- `benches/btree_lookup.rs` -- point lookup latency
- `benches/parser_throughput.rs` -- statements parsed per second
- `benches/mvcc_contention.rs` -- concurrent writer throughput (1-128 writers)
- `benches/tpc_b.rs` -- TPC-B-like mixed workload
- `benches/concurrent_rw.rs` -- mixed read/write with varying ratios
- `benches/wal_checkpoint.rs` -- checkpoint speed under load

**Acceptance criteria:**
- CLI usable as a drop-in sqlite3 replacement for interactive use
- 95%+ conformance against golden file suite
- Documented benchmark results with comparison to C SQLite
- 4,000+ tests passing across the entire workspace

---

### Verification Gate (All Phases)

Every phase must pass this gate before proceeding:

1. `cargo check --workspace` -- zero errors
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` -- zero warnings
3. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` -- correctly formatted
4. `cargo test --workspace` -- all tests pass
5. `cargo bench --workspace` -- no performance regressions (Phase 4+)

Additional verification for Phase 6+:

6. Stress test: 100 threads x 100 writes -- all rows present, no corruption
7. Long-running reader + concurrent writer: snapshot consistency verified
8. Kill-and-recover: data integrity after forced process termination
9. Memory growth under sustained MVCC load: GC keeps version count bounded

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per-Crate)

Every crate contains `#[test]` modules exercising individual components in
isolation. Trait dependencies are satisfied with mock implementations.

**Coverage targets by crate:**
- `fsqlite-types`: Serialization round-trips, varint encoding/decoding, value
  type conversions, serial type encoding/decoding
- `fsqlite-error`: Error construction, display formatting, error code mapping
- `fsqlite-vfs`: MemoryVfs read/write/truncate/lock, UnixVfs file operations
- `fsqlite-pager`: Page cache eviction, dirty page tracking, pager state
  transitions, journal integration
- `fsqlite-wal`: Frame encoding/decoding, WAL index operations, checkpoint
  correctness, recovery from partial writes
- `fsqlite-mvcc`: Visibility rule correctness, conflict detection, GC
  reclaimability, snapshot consistency, page lock table semantics
- `fsqlite-btree`: Cell parsing, page splitting/merging, cursor traversal,
  overflow chains, freelist, integrity checking
- `fsqlite-parser`: Token stream verification, AST structure for all statement
  types, error recovery, edge cases
- `fsqlite-planner`: Name resolution, index selection, cost model calculations
- `fsqlite-vdbe`: Individual opcode semantics, type affinity conversions, sort
  correctness
- `fsqlite-func`: All built-in function return values and edge cases
- Extensions: Each function and virtual table independently tested

### Integration Tests

Located in `tests/` at workspace root and within `fsqlite-core`. These test the
full pipeline from SQL text to result rows:

- **DDL tests**: CREATE TABLE/INDEX/VIEW/TRIGGER, ALTER TABLE, DROP
- **DML tests**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with various WHERE clauses
- **Query tests**: SELECT with joins, subqueries, aggregation, window functions,
  CTEs
- **Transaction tests**: BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK, savepoints, auto-commit
- **Persistence tests**: Write, close, reopen, verify (using `tempfile`)
- **WAL tests**: Concurrent reader/writer scenarios
- **MVCC tests**: Concurrent writer scenarios, conflict detection, snapshot
  isolation

### Property-Based Tests (proptest)

- **B-tree invariant testing**: Random sequences of insert/delete/lookup
  operations must maintain B-tree ordering invariants and page structure
  validity.
- **Parser round-trip**: Parse SQL, pretty-print AST, re-parse -- the two ASTs
  must be structurally equivalent.
- **MVCC linearizability**: Random interleaving of concurrent transactions must
  produce results consistent with some serial ordering.
- **Record format**: Random SqliteValue sequences must survive encode/decode
  round-trip.

### Fuzz Tests (cargo-fuzz)

Targeted at components that process untrusted input:
- SQL parser (arbitrary byte strings as SQL input)
- Record decoder (arbitrary byte strings as record data)
- B-tree page decoder (arbitrary byte strings as page content)
- WAL frame decoder (arbitrary byte strings as WAL content)

### Conformance Harness (`fsqlite-harness`)

The golden-file conformance system:

1. **Generation**: Run SQL scripts against the C `sqlite3` binary, capture
   stdout/stderr as golden files stored in `conformance/golden/`.
2. **Verification**: Run the same SQL scripts against `fsqlite`, compare output
   row-by-row against golden files.
3. **Reporting**: Produce a conformance matrix showing pass/fail/skip per test
   file, with diff output for failures.
4. **Target**: 95%+ pass rate across 1,000+ test SQL files.

### File Format Round-Trip

A key test category creates databases with the C SQLite library, reads them
with FrankenSQLite (and vice versa), and verifies identical query results.
This ensures file format compatibility is maintained. Includes byte-level
comparison of page contents for known datasets.

### Concurrency Stress Tests (Phase 6+)

- 100 threads x 100 writes: verify all 10,000 rows present, no corruption
- Long-running reader + concurrent writer: snapshot consistency
- Kill-and-recover: data integrity after forced process termination
- Memory growth under sustained MVCC load: GC keeps version count bounded
- Checkpoint under concurrent write load: no corruption, no reader blocking

### Crash Recovery Verification

- **Power-loss simulation**: Simulate incomplete writes at every possible byte
  boundary during WAL append and checkpoint. Verify recovery correctness.
- **Kill-9 testing**: Run write workload, send SIGKILL at random points,
  restart and verify with `PRAGMA integrity_check`.
- **Bit-flip testing**: Random bit flips in WAL and database files; verify
  checksum detection rather than silent wrong results.

### Cumulative Test Count Targets

| Phase | Cumulative Tests |
|-------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Workspace compiles, specification complete |
| Phase 2 | 200+ |
| Phase 3 | 500+ |
| Phase 4 | 1,000+ |
| Phase 5 | 1,500+ |
| Phase 6 | 2,000+ |
| Phase 7 | 3,000+ |
| Phase 8 | 3,500+ |
| Phase 9 | 4,000+ |

## 7. Risk Assessment

### High Risk

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **MVCC overhead exceeds budget.** Page-level versioning adds memory and CPU cost per page access. If overhead exceeds 2x for non-contended workloads, the concurrency benefit may not justify the cost. | High | Medium | Benchmark continuously from Phase 6. Buffer pool eviction of superseded versions keeps memory bounded. Page lock table uses `BTreeMap` (not `HashMap`) for cache-friendly access patterns. Profile and optimize hot paths with `criterion`. |
| **B-tree balancing correctness.** The page splitting/merging algorithms in `btree.c` are among the most complex and subtle code in SQLite (~4,000 lines for balance_nonroot alone). Correctness bugs here corrupt data silently. | High | Medium | Extensive property-based testing with `proptest` (random insert/delete sequences). Integrity check function runs after every test. Compare B-tree structure against C SQLite for identical insertion sequences. |
| **File format incompatibility.** Subtle encoding differences (varint edge cases, cell pointer alignment, overflow threshold calculations) could produce files that C SQLite rejects or misreads. | High | Medium | Golden-file round-trip tests: create with FrankenSQLite, read with C SQLite (and vice versa). Byte-level comparison of page contents for known datasets. Test with databases up to 1GB. |

### Medium Risk

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Parser coverage gaps.** SQLite's grammar has accumulated many extensions and edge cases over 20+ years. A hand-written parser may miss obscure syntax accepted by the LEMON-generated parser. | Medium | High | Use `parse.y` as the authoritative grammar reference. Fuzz the parser with SQL extracted from real-world applications. Conformance harness catches syntax acceptance differences. |
| **WAL crash recovery correctness.** Incorrect WAL replay after a crash can lose committed transactions or apply uncommitted ones. | High | Low | Simulate crashes at every possible point in the commit sequence (before WAL write, after WAL write but before checkpoint, mid-checkpoint). Verify database integrity and transaction atomicity after recovery. |
| **Query planner regression.** Different plan choices than C SQLite could cause dramatic performance differences for specific query patterns, even if the average is acceptable. | Medium | Medium | Start with a conservative planner that mimics C SQLite's heuristics. Use EXPLAIN comparison tests. Add ANALYZE support early. |
| **Extension behavioral differences.** Extensions like FTS5 and JSON1 have large surface areas with many edge cases in ranking, tokenization, and JSON path evaluation. | Medium | Medium | Conformance harness with extension-specific test SQL files. Port existing extension test cases from the C source tree. |
| **MVCC GC stalls.** If garbage collection does not keep pace with version creation under high write throughput, memory usage grows unboundedly. | Medium | Medium | Configurable GC interval via PRAGMA. GC runs in background without blocking writers. Monitor version chain length and buffer pool size. Alert when approaching capacity. |

### Low Risk

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Nightly Rust breakage.** Using nightly channel means compiler updates can break builds. | Low | Medium | Pin toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Update periodically with full test suite. Avoid depending on unstable features likely to change. |
| **asupersync API changes.** asupersync is an internal library that may evolve. | Low | Low | Isolate asupersync usage behind internal abstraction layers. VFS trait already provides this isolation for file I/O. |
| **Deadlock in MVCC.** Despite the eager-locking design intended to prevent deadlocks, subtle bugs could introduce waiting cycles. | High | Low | Deadlock freedom is structural (no transaction ever waits while holding a page lock). Property-based tests with arbitrary transaction interleavings verify this invariant. Timeouts as a safety net. |
